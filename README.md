# Game of Life

<small>*and variations*</small>

This repo contains a Game of Life simulator written in Rust using Macroquad. A Config UI allows customisation of the simulation such as the ruleset and colours.

In the future I will revisit this to add multi-state support to allow simulations such as Wireworld and Cyclic cellular automaton.
